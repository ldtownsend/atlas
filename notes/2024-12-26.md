### Entry 1:

I decided to change my initial approach for this game. I'm going back to building a fast prototype and will decide how to group the different attributes and functionality after I get a bad first version done.

Because I did reach for some abstraction first, I'll have some really weird mixed state and bad code. That's fine. I don't think I was over-confident in my ability to keep the whole game in my head while putting together the different classes, I think if I'd had one 4-6 hour session to work on this I'd have been able to complete the prototype with the approach I was using.

The trouble is that's difficult to do while I'm trying to work on this in 30-90 minute increments with several days in between. So I need to just get a working version written down and can make the right abstractions from there...

### Entry 2:

Next steps: handle what happens after the initial unit dispersement in round 0

- add ability to move units to adjacent territories
- work on `combat.py` to write initial combat mechanisms
- add coin and units per round attribute for each territory
  - modify `territory.py` to add attribute to class
  - modify `game.py` to change how the board is initiated
