### Entry 1:

I've added the ability to move units, but only to territories already owned by the current player.

I still need to add the logic for combat. It needs to involve rolling the dice and letting combat play out. I'll keep this totally random at the unit level.

### Entry 2:

I should add changing colors to the highlight which player is active and should highlight their territories as well.

### Entry 3:

The logic has pretty much all gotten written out in the ui_handler.py file. That's fine for now. I know it isn't even close to right and I'll reorganize later.
